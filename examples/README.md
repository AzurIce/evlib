## Troubleshooting

### Polars Issues
- **Import Error**: Install with `pip install polars` or `pip install evlib[polars]`
- **Performance Issues**: Use lazy evaluation and optimize query order
- **Memory Errors**: Use chunked processing for large datasets
- **API Errors**: Import from `evlib.polars_utils` for utility functions

### GStreamer Issues
- **Import Error**: Ensure GStreamer system libraries are installed
- **Build Failure**: Check that pkg-config can find GStreamer libraries
- **Runtime Error**: Verify webcam permissions and device availability

### Performance Tips
- **Use Polars DataFrames** for datasets >10K events
- **Use lazy evaluation** for complex multi-step operations
- **Apply filters early** to reduce data size
- **Use release builds** for benchmarking: `maturin develop --release`
- **Leverage built-in utility functions** instead of custom implementations
