# evlib: Development Status and Roadmap

## Current Status: Stable and Functional

After comprehensive cleanup and refactoring, evlib is now in a stable state with core functionality verified and working.

---

## **COMPLETED ACHIEVEMENTS**

### **Core Functionality - WORKING**
- **Data Loading**: Universal format support (H5, AEDAT, EVT2/3, AER, text) with automatic format detection
- **Event Representations**: Stacked histogram representations based on proven RVT patterns
- **Data Processing**: Event filtering, time range selection, and polarity handling
- **Real Data Support**: Tested with actual datasets including eTram, Gen4, and original H5 data
- **Python Integration**: Clean Rust backend with Python bindings via PyO3
- **Comprehensive Examples**: Working notebooks demonstrating all core functionality

### **Quality Assurance - COMPLETED**
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed all emojis, placeholder implementations, and fake functionality
- **Architecture**: Proper separation between Rust implementation and Python bindings
- **Testing**: All notebooks pass `pytest --nbmake` validation
- **Documentation**: Updated README and examples to reflect actual working features
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of sparse data and edge cases

### **Removed Features - CLEANED UP**
- **Voxel Grid Functionality**: Removed due to implementation issues
- **Neural Network Models**: Removed placeholder/fake implementations
- **Complex Visualization**: Simplified to working core functionality
- **Error Handling in Notebooks**: Removed to show immediate failures
- **Mock Data**: All examples now use real datasets

## **CURRENT WORKING FEATURES**

### **Data I/O**
- `load_events()`: Universal event data loading with automatic format detection
- Format support: H5, AEDAT, EVT2/3, AER, text files
- Handles sparse data distributions correctly
- Memory-efficient processing of large files (550MB+)

### **Event Representations**
- `create_event_histogram()`: Stacked histogram representation
- `create_time_surface()`: Time-based event surfaces
- `filter_events_by_time()`: Time range filtering
- Polarity encoding conversion (0/1 â†” -1/1)

### **Development Tools**
- Comprehensive test suite with real data
- Working example notebooks
- Build system with maturin
- Proper Python environment setup

---

## **IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES**

### **1. Bug Fixes and Stability**

- Document build and development process

---

## **MEDIUM-TERM ROADMAP**

### **Enhanced Data Processing**
- Additional event filtering options (spatial, polarity-based)
- Event transformation functions (rotation, scaling, translation)
- Statistical analysis functions (event rates, distribution analysis)

### **Visualization Improvements**
- Terminal-based event visualization
- Real-time event stream display
- Export capabilities for processed data

### **Format Extensions**
- Additional event camera formats as needed
- Stream processing capabilities
- Real-time data ingestion

---

## **LONG-TERM VISION**

### **Advanced Features**
- Real-time event processing pipeline
- GPU acceleration for compute-intensive operations
- Integration with popular event processing frameworks

### **Community Integration**
- PyPI package distribution
- Integration with existing event processing workflows
- Community-driven format support

---

## **DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW**

### **Current Standards**
- All code must work with real data (no mock implementations)
- Test-driven development with `pytest` and `cargo test`
- Format code with `black` (Python) and `rustfmt` (Rust)
- Validate notebooks with `pytest --nbmake`

### **Quality Gates**
- All tests must pass before merging
- Real data validation required for new features
- Performance regression testing for large files
- Documentation updates for new functionality

---

## **TECHNICAL DEBT - RESOLVED**

### **Architecture Issues - FIXED**
- Separated implementation from interface (`__init__.py` now imports only)
- Proper Rust-Python bindings without fallback implementations
- Clean module organization with clear responsibilities

### **Code Quality - IMPROVED**
- Removed all placeholder code and mock implementations
- Eliminated emoji usage throughout codebase
- Standardized error handling patterns
- Consistent coding style across Python and Rust components

### **Testing Infrastructure - ESTABLISHED**
- Real data test cases for all supported formats
- Comprehensive notebook validation
- Performance testing framework
- Automated formatting and quality checks

---

## **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **Current Achievements**
- **100% real data compatibility**: All examples work with actual event camera data
- **Format universality**: Single `load_events()` function handles all supported formats
- **Stability**: All notebooks pass validation without errors
- **Performance**: Handles large datasets (550MB+) efficiently
- **Code quality**: Clean, maintainable codebase without technical debt

### **Future Targets**
- **Performance**: Sub-second loading for typical datasets
- **Format coverage**: Support for emerging event camera formats
- **Community adoption**: Active usage in research and development
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples

---

## **CONCLUSION**

evlib has successfully transitioned from a development prototype to a stable, functional library. The focus has shifted from accumulating features to ensuring reliability and usability with real-world data. The library now provides a solid foundation for event camera data processing with room for targeted enhancements based on user needs.

**Current Status**: Ready for production use with core event processing functionality.
**Next Phase**: Incremental improvements and community-driven feature development.
