## 🌐 **EVLIB-STUDIO WEB APPLICATION**

### Project Concept
A companion web application providing an intuitive interface for event-based vision processing, inspired by [rpg_vid2e](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_vid2e) but powered by evlib's comprehensive algorithms.

### Architecture Approach
**Recommended**: Separate repository (`evlib-studio`) that uses evlib as core processing engine
- **Benefits**: Clean separation, focused development, easier deployment
- **Integration**: Python bindings as API layer

```python
# Example evlib-studio integration
import evlib.simulation as sim
import evlib.reconstruction as recon

# Video-to-Events conversion
converter = sim.VideoToEventsConverter(config)
events = converter.convert_video_file("input.mp4")

# Events-to-Video reconstruction
model = recon.E2VID(variant="unet", pretrained=True)
frames = model.reconstruct(events)
```
